# AI-ML Assignment

The main aim of our project is to develop an Astronomy Image Classifier.
 The Hubble Space Telescope is an astronomical observatory that was launched on April
 24, 1990, and has provided a series of beautiful and wide-ranging images of space,
 capturing galaxies and comets.
 Since 1970 there have been more than 90 Space Telescopes placed into Orbit by NASA
 and ESA.
 It is evident from these facts that there has always been a need for astronomy image
 classification. We try to classify images into several categories that include
 constellations, stars, nebulae, planets,etc.
 Deep learning techniques are used widely for image recognition and classification
 problems. Gradually, deep learning architectures have modified to comprise more layers
 and become a more robust model for classification problems. Convolutional Neural
 Networks is widely used for image classification as it gives more accuracy in classifying
 large and complicated images.
 A convolutional neural network is a class of deep learning which deals with processing
 image and video data by extracting features from them and building a
